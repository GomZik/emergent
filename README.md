Emergent
========
Emergent is an experimental project with a full access for everyone. Send a pull request and you'll be added as a contributor. Main idea is to organize ourselves and create something exciting.

## Programming language
It's supposed to be written in Python. This may change during the process of evolution.

## Libraries and server configurations
There is a tiny framework (Bottle) installed on the server.
We are at the very beginning right now and it's not very clear how to interact with the server. So if you need specific configurations or libraries feel free to write directly to the author https://github.com/averrin

Поставил свежую Джангу. Настроил на скорую руку, ибо на природу собираюсь. Сейчас настрою чтобы деплоилось хорошо и укачу. Зависимости из requiremants ставятся автоматом.
